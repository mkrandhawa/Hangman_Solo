# Hangman_Solo
Guess the random word chosen by the system.

The game has been written using Python and therefore I recommend to use an IDE that is compatible with .py files. 
The game is simple to play.
The system chooses a random word from the given list of numbers and the user has to guess the word. 
Each line has been commented for better understanding.
